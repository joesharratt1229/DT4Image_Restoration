Am on mobile.\n\n\nWe have just given notice on the house we have lived in for 2 years with the landlord. \n\n\nA couple of weeks ago, we noticed that a crack had appeared on the induction hob. The hob still works fine, but the crack is noticeable. We don't know how it happened but admit that we must have caused the damage somehow - possibly while packing up the kitchen. The oven is a built in oven and came as part of the property. \n\n\nThe landlord came to inspect the property today and he has asked us to make a claim through our own home contents insurance for accidental damage for the hob.\n\n\nI am hesitant to do this as the hob is a fixture of the property and is not ours, so I don't think it's right that we should have to claim for this. If we do have to claim, then we will lose our no claims bonus and have to pay the excess for this. Although the damage was done by us, I feel the money for the repairs should come either out of our deposit or be claimed through the landlords insurance, rather than our own. \n\n\nI don't want to be awkward if this is normal, but it just doesn't seem right to me. Does anyone know if this is commonplace or what the normal process should be so we can decide what would be best to do? Any advise would be much appreciated."", 'Can anyone advise if my mortgage application process seems normal?\n\n \n\nSo for context we are buying a relatives property which is currently occupied by a tenant.

1,0,39,0_Home Insurance Considerations for Property Exchange and Completion,['Home Insurance Considerations for Property Exchange and Completion'],"['We\'re about to exchange contracts on a house and will be completing around 8 weeks later. We need to buy buildings insurance for the period between exchange and completion - at which point we\'ll amend or take out a different policy.\n\nAfter checking comparison sites and speaking to insurers directly we\'ve found that none of the mainstream insurers we\'ve spoken to offer this type of buildings insurance because:\n\n* It\'s not our primary residence\n* We don\'t yet own the property (we\'re legally bound to buy it, but we don\'t legally own it until completion)\n* It\'s occupied by the current owners  (but there are products for unoccupied properties and new builds)\n\nIf we took out a conventional buildings insurance policy we\'d be screwed in the event of a claim through not meeting the basic criteria above.\n\nCan anyone recommend an insurer that has a product that covers house buying between exchange and completion?  \n\n\n**UPDATE:** After doing further research and making more calls to insurers:  \n\n\n* We now have insurance through **Urban Jungle**. They offer month-by-month cover which you can cancel at any time and amendments/cancellation are free.\n* Spoke to **LV** based on u/ICThat\'s recommendation. Their standard building insurance can be used but only if you are completing within 60 days of exchange. Perfect for us, but their quote was prohibitively expensive.\n* **Exchange2Completion** (catchy name!) offer bespoke insurance for this purpose, but you must have had a professional survey completed within 16 weeks of taking out the policy - which, in our case, was longer than that - otherwise subsidence/heaving/etc. is not covered, and that\'s typically a dealbreaker for a mortgage company. The quote was a bit high for such a short period, but at least you\'d be dealing with an insurance company that deals with these specific types of policy/claims.\n* **Intelligent insurance** have an *""I have not moved in yet""* option. Price was good for the year but the compulsorary excess numbers were ridiculously high.\n\nSome general tips based on some things I saw on many sites:  \n\n\n* Make sure you\'re given an opportunity to name an ""interested/connected party"" on the application - if you\'re taking out a mortgage, this will be your bank or building society. They\'re buying your house too! Some sites didn\'t ask this question.\n* Make sure excesses are clear and obvious to you. Some sites ""hid"" these behind links (I\'m looking at you, Intelligent Insurance). Some excesses may also be covered in an endorsements section, e.g. a higher excess speicifcally for storm damage.\n* If you\'re taking out a long policy with the intention of cancelling not long after, you\'ll typically pay a fee (e.g. £60) if it\'s after the 14-day cooling off period.\n* Check what\'s covered in detail. Got a flat roof? Most insurers will state that you\'re only covered if it\'s been inspected by a professional in the 12 months *prior* to taking out the policy and every X years after that. Drains, guttering and mains pipes covered? Not always - sometimes this is extra above the basic policy.\n* If in doubt, call the insurance company. I spoke to many helpful people who were upfront about what the policy did and didn\'t cover. It\'s time-consuming, but you\'ll sleep better at night knowing you\'re definitely covered.\n* Where possible, obtain a quote online. 99% of the time this will be cheaper compared to obtaining a quote by phone.  \n', 'Hello,\n\nI am due to exchange on a flat on Monday and would then have 1-2 weeks between exchange and completion.

2,1,37,1_Issues with subsidence and insurance in property purchases,['Issues with subsidence and insurance in property purchases'],"['I have a small flat that is leasehold property in a block of purpose built apartments in Wales, which I purchased 17 years ago. Throughout that time there has been subsidence affecting myself and a few of my neighbours, with signs both inside and outside our properties. \n\nWhen purchasing the property, I had a survey done that noted “signs of historic movement, likely not active”. At that time it was some very small cracking on an external wall that had been refilled with some cement (repointed) some years prior. It still passed the survey for mortgage purposes but as the years have gone on the damage has been apparent in other parts of the building and as such I am no longer able to get a new mortgage or remortgage my own. \n\nThree separate mortgage application surveyors I’ve had when applying for new products say that they will not give any lending in the current condition and as it was mentioned on my original survey I have no recourse through my original surveyor. \n\nOver the last decade, I have attempted to resolve the matter through the property’s management company. The freehold is owned by the residents (so I have a 1/28th share of this company) but they employ a property management company to deal with all issues. My efforts in trying to deal with the issue get me nowhere. \n\nOriginally a claim was made on the building’s insurance policy. This was declined as they stated that signs of subsidence (even if historic) were apparent prior to the policy taken out. Apparently there had been a change of insurance provider at some point. The management company then brought in their own surveyor who monitored the movement for over a year and stated the movement had stopped. The management company then appealed the building insurance’s decision, which again failed, then went to the ombudsman. Last month they deemed to much time had elapsed since the original claim and as it was over 6 years ago nothing could be done. I feel the management company have done a poor job in this process to ensure the issue was rectified by insurance. \n\nThroughout this time I have asked the management company what would be their plan of action if the subsidence could not be covered under insurance. They seem out of their depth with what would need to take place and state the resident’s company that they are employed by have little enthusiasm to rectify the problem or raise service charges to fund remedial work. They are mostly elderly residents who fail to see an urgency or motivation to get it sorted. I feel they are likely not upholding their legal responsibilities in getting addressing the issue. \n\nMovement still seems active in the property itself. The management company has periodically covered the cost of contractors to patch up internal cracking but it still continues to affect residents. They wish to just continue with this course of action, as it shows they are doing something about it but not actually addressing the cause of the issue. There is now a six inch incline from one side of my flat to the other which is very noticeable. My property is un-mortgageable, unsellable and I fear at some point will become uninhabitable due to safety concerns. \n\nI have told the management company they have a legal duty to rectify the situation, although I am unsure what I should be doing to ensure this is taken seriously. \n\nI’d be grateful for any help or advice please. Thanks. \n', 'We are around two weeks away from exchange on a 1930s house in a clay area *(London, England)* and I\'ve become a worried about insuring the building, I am under the impression we do not have to declare it as the insurance company decline it in 2022 with the following statement:\n\n> ""The engineer has confirmed that there is no evidence of recent or progressive subsidence damage to the property, and there is no cover for the cost of repairs under the subsidence section of the policy.""\n\nThe report details that ""The damage is related to floor joist movement and historical repairs and thermal movement.""\n\nIn response to this the seller then completed a independant structual report and remideal building works to address the structual issues discovered to be the cause of the issue in early/mid 2023, which included:\n\n- Repairs in the undercroft (rebuilding 4 debonded brick piers, new central cross sleeper wall with lintel to support failed widened central cross wall )\n- Repair interior / exterior cracks\n\nThis work has been complete, the seller has provided a letter from the builder stating it was done to the specifications of the inpendant survey findings, it was however flagged in my level 3 report:\n\n> ""In addition, in the cellar it is apparent that sleeper walls and brick piers have been rebuilt at some time in the\npast to provide more reliable support to the walls and suspended timber floors. These\nstructural improvements have been effective. Normally, Building Regulations approval would be required for\nsuch structural alterations, and we recommend that your conveyancer makes the necessary enquiries to\nestablish whether Building Regulations approval was sought and granted. If no formal consent was given, a\nstructural engineer should be appointed to assess the suitability, strength and stability of the sleeper walls and\nbrick piers.""\n\nMy conveyancer found no building regulations were granted, so asking the seller to get the original surveyor to sign it off, our surveyor didn\'t know the history but from my own research building regulations are only needed for removal, not increasing support anyway seems like a good idea to have it checked over again.\n\n---\n\nAnyway last week I instructed a independant insurance broker as sugested by my conveyancer and provided supporting documents saying it is not subsidence, they\'re sending them to the underwriter today and their phone call is stressing me out, they said: ""We have to declare subsidence due to the area being at risk of subsidence in your report"", I have not seen that anywhere the only place is some ass covering in the level 3 report:\n\n> ""The purchaser will have to accept the risk that significant cracking may occur at some point in the future with subsidence becoming increasingly common due to long periods of dry weather.""\n\nThe two questions that are asked when doing an online quotes are, which I think both are no:\n\n* The property has not previously been underpinned or otherwise had its foundation reinforced - no because a sleeper wall isn\'t foundations\n* The property has never shown any signs of or been monitored for subsidence, landslip or heave - no because the claim was rejected\n\n\nI have discussed this with my conveyancer and they agree with my assumptions, in hindsight I should have looked at insurance earlier, but now I am somewhat worried, what are your thoughts?', 'Currently in the process of purchasing my first home. It’s was built in 1930. The house has a loft conversion which cannot be used or advertised as a bedroom, but I only plan on using it for storage. However I am running into a lot of issues and wondering whether at this point it’s best to pull out. The loft is pretty big, has a skylight window and a staircase leading to the first floor. My solicitor and the sellers solicitor have been going back and fourth for months. I put the offer in on the house in September. The seller is unable to provide any planning or building regulations as it was done before they moved in. Here is what my solicitor is saying:\n\n\nWith reference to the above matter, the loft conversion remains a matter of concern due to the lack of building regulations approval.\n \nThese works amount to a significant structural alteration to the property and pose two concerns:\n \n1. Whilst the works may be outside of the statutory enforcement period of one year, if the works are deemed to be unsafe, there is no enforcement period. It may be possible to protect against the risk of legal enforcement with a legal indemnity insurance policy.\n \nHowever, this insurance would only provide cover against the cost of legal enforcement in the event that legal action was taken. It will not cover the cost of any remedial works as a result of the defect.\n \nIf you choose to proceed with indemnity insurance, you will be unable to disclose the policy to anybody, including the Building Control Department. Should you wish to carry out further works in the future that require Building Regulations, you may invalidate the insurance in inviting the Inspector to review your other works.\n \nYou would need to fund the cost of the policy if the Sellers refuse to pay for it.\n \n2. The second is the issue of safety. Building Regulations exist to provide some security that works covered by the Regulations are safe and pose no threat to life. In the absence of a Building Regulations Completion Certificate we have no evidence that the works are safe. This may pose a risk to you and any other occupiers of the property. You may also find that your building insurance policy is invalidated as a consequence.\n \nAdditionally, should you wish to let the property out in the future, you must ensure that the property is fit and safe for any prospective tenants. Should a tenant be injured or worse, you may face both civil and criminal liability for allowing the property to be let despite it being unsafe.\n \nOur advice therefore is to insist on a Regularisation Certificate (retrospective inspection certificate) but the Sellers are likely to resist this and we accept that you may not wish to pursue this route.\n \nYou should consider making enquiries with your surveyor as to their opinion on the structural adequacy of the works. You may need to instruct a further full structural survey.\n \nShould you decide that you are happy to accept the risk and proceed with legal indemnity insurance, we will need to report this matter to your lender and ask them to refer it to their surveyor. They may request further surveys, at your cost, or they may decline to lend.\n \nWe have asked the seller’s solicitor to provide a draft indemnity insurance policy in this instance as we understand an application for a regularisation certificate was applied for but you understood from the seller that they were told by the local authority that the works did not meet current standards and that an indemnity insurance policy should be taken out. This is unusual for the party who can carry out enforcement proceedings to recommend an insurance policy against themselves. We have asked for further information and for a draft policy to be provided once full disclosure has been made to the indemnity insurers of the approach and the response received.\n \nYou should also be aware that the loft room cannot be classed as a habitable room until such time as it is brought up to current standards and a regularisation certificate obtained; until such time, you could not class it as an additional room for valuation purposes.\n \nWe have asked the sellers lawyers to confirm what has been said with the council. If you are happy to proceed without the regularisation certificate we can refer the matter to your lender to ensure they are happy i.e. this would not affect their valuation, are you happy for us to do this?']"
3,2,31,2_Issues with Building Insurance and Maintenance in Leasehold Flats,['Issues with Building Insurance and Maintenance in Leasehold Flats'],"['Longish read; TLDR at the end!\n\nHi! Not sure this is the right forum for this question but here goes! I live in a block of flats (leasehold), moved in about ten years ago, the building itself is eighteen years old. When buying insurance I was told I can only get contents insurance, as I don’t technically own the building to get building insurance. We pay a monthly fee to a building maintenance company whose job it is to affect repairs to communal areas and the external face of the building.\n\nMy neighbour was in the process of having a new shower installed, during which some tiles needed to be removed. Apparently his plumber was aghast at what he saw underneath- very little waterproofing, wet/damp plasterboard and insulation, and not really enough timber battens for a wall of that type. He said that a single flaw in the mastic around the bathtub meant that water from the shower got in the walls and mucked everything up. The plumber thinks the issue was simply shoddy workmanship and corner-cutting on the part of the builder, and to fix the damage would cost at least £4000.\n\nAs the building is over ten years old, my neighbour has no recourse to seek damages from the builder, and because he has contents insurance only, it doesn’t cover the damage to the structure of the walls. The maintenance company can’t help as their contract doesn’t cover inside the individual flats (except for ducting and pipe work).\n\nI’m now worried this could happen to me and end up having to fork out £4K to fix my walls. I have re-pointed my bathtub but am still worried about the state of the walls beneath the bathroom tiles. Is there any sort of insurance I could take out that would cover me for any such future damage?\n\nMy flat is in England.\n\nTLDR, neighbour in block of flats just spent £4K to fix his ruined bathroom wall; how can I mitigate against the same issue befalling my flat?', ""(england) Hi all. This isn't quite a straightforward situation but looking for advice on what is best to do at the moment.\n\nSo my mother owns a flat in a building managed by the council, shes currently mentally unwell and has been vacant from the property for some time. I check in every so often and after checking in today there is water leaking from the ceiling, the ceiling is damaged, mould is growing on it, mould has grown on the sofa, lice on the walls, etc etc. House reeks of urine.\n\nThe upstairs property was also vacant, and they had a burst pipe because of the cold weather and thus a flood. So essentially these are the questions I have.\n\nMy mum has a morgage that has a metric shit ton of arrears, has not paid herself into any insurance in years and years, not paid the service charges from the council in years and years. Contents insurance out of the question obviously, the family seems to think there would be some sort of cover for the essential repairs, but to me that seems rather too hopeful. The morgage company are dragging their feet and just refuse to repossess, I don't know why, and they have had at least 5 years now, definetly more, with no payments and my mum has only officially been unwell for 2 years, but before that as far as official records go, no problem was known, thats a whole seperate though. Is there likely to be any cover?\n\nThe landlord of the upstairs property seems pretty reasonable, he has accepted that its his fault and offered to buy a de-humidifier and asked about insurance to which I had no idea when he asked, I got the impression if there was no cover he would be willing to do something to get things moving as the state of the property may or may not mean he cant get new tenants. If my mum is not able to engage with whoever she needs to for repairs, might he be able to initiate some sort of legal proceedings if hes unable to put in new tenants?\n\nIdeally the flat needs to just be gotten rid of. But unfortunately my mum is unwilling to do that and I recognise that until there is a court order then that has to be her decision.\n\nFurthermore the electrics, if we did get the demhumidifer, the light fixtures have been filled with water, I assume that we will need the go ahead from an electrician to even consider turning on the electric (its cut off at the meter as it hasn't been topped up).\n\nAlso, leaks from the upstairs property is not a new issue. The bathroom ceiling fell in a few years ago due to the upstairs leaks and the kitchen ceiling hasn't got much longer to go because this recent leak has made it bulging. Not sure if this is relevant or not.\n\nWhat can we do to limit any damage to the building? It looks like there are some unsavoury things living there. The mould in the sofa looks like someones ran their finger over it (we suspect maybe a mouse or lice or something has been at it).\n\nIs there anything else that I should be aware of? I think I know where I myself stand legally, I recognise that absoloutly none of this is my responsibility to engage with and that I can't make any decisions without my mum giving the go ahead herself, I just want to make sure that the least amount of hassle is caused, its been suggested that its possible that if left unactioned, this could write off the whole building? That sounds like a headache that nobody wants"", 'Hello all,\n\nI’m at a bit of a loss what to do and seeking advice. I bought a leasehold flat 6 months ago. Last Wednesday I got an email while at work from my building management company which said a leak has been reported from my flat which has caused the ceiling to cave in on the flat below and gave me the contact details of the tenant in the flat. I immediately left work and contacted the tenant, I live a 5 minute walk away from work so arrived to the damaged flat within minutes. The tenant was aware of the leak for a few days, his ceiling fan started dripping whenever I was showering and the day before the ceiling caved his light fixture completely filled with water. I’m unsure why I wasn’t made aware of this until the ceiling fell through.\n\nThis is the first property I’ve owned and not experienced this before so I did just assume as this was from my flat I was liable for the damage so after stopping the water in my flat, I got the balling rolling with contacting my personal home insurance to fix the flat below. They advised me that actually the landlord of the flat below should be claiming off her own insurance to fix the damage. I contacted the landlord who was understandably not happy, and I advised her what I had been told from my insurance. She claimed she should not being doing that as it’s my fault the flat is damaged. \n\nShe then contacted the management company who agreed with her, so I contacted the management company myself to confirm if this was the case. They said yes I’m liable for the damage out of pocket. To confirm, I was completely unaware of this leak. I asked the management company what do I pay personal insurance and a service charge for if I’m not even covered in these circumstances. I was then told I could see if the building insurance would cover it so they gave me the insurer details.\n\nI contacted the insurer and they told me based on the information gave I have nothing to worry about, and once again advised that the landlord should be using her landlord home insurance to get the tenant support as soon as possible, and then can mitigate her losses through the building insurance. I informed the landlord of this right away. She was refusing to use her insurance but said she will arrange a builder to come to the flat. \n\nI arranged a plumber to come out to my flat (so the problem was fixed within 24 hours of it being reported to me), who confirmed a faulty waste pipe under my bath. I updated the landlord of this at 2pm the following day and then she asked if I wanted to arrange my own contractor to sort the damage in her flat, or her arrange her own and bill me the money. As this was the following day I’d been reading online that it’s the landlords responsibility and as I didn’t intentionally cause a leak (like overflowing the bath or leaving taps on), I’m not fully liable. I again informed her that two insurance companies have advised me the correct way to manage this is to use her insurance and told her I’d already opened up a claim with the building insurance. I gave her the insurance details and didn’t hear anything more from her. On Friday (the following day after my last conversation with the landlord), the tenant informed me builders have arrived to fix his ceiling. So it took two full days for the landlord to arrange fixing damage to her flat.\n\nToday she has contacted me to ask if I’d contacted the freeholder to open a claim. This completely confused me as I’m not sure why I’d be contacting the owner of building? She then told me she has not contacted the building insurance and I’ve just found out the landlord doesn’t have home insurance for the flat at all.\n\nThe damages are £800 so far. If she doesn’t have home insurance, what are the options here? Will the building insurance pay out directly to her if I’m covered? I understand a leak came from my flat, but as mentioned it wasn’t from my nuisance or negligence. This is really stressing me out (as I’m sure it is for the landlord) but dealing with a landlord that doesn’t seem to be aware of their responsibilities as a landlord is causing even more stress .\n\nHave I misunderstood my duties here and I’m actually in the wrong? Should I be paying the £800 out of goodwill, or wait for the building insurance outcome? Any advice at all on how to proceed would be appreciated.']"
4,3,27,3_Issues with Freehold Ownership and Leasehold Arrangements in Residential Properties,['Issues with Freehold Ownership and Leasehold Arrangements in Residential Properties'],"['We bought a leasehold house for £460,000 in 2021. The lease began in 1893 and has 1869 years left on it now. The ground rent is £12 a year (though I note that the landlord refers to its extortionate insurance charge as ‘insurance rent’ on the insurance invoice). I asked to buy the freehold and was quoted in August 23 ‘a consideration of £8000 plus their survey fee £350+vat and legal fees £1,140+ vat’. I’ve tried online calculation tools and they come back with a £0 freehold valuation. \n\nI’m a bit (a lot ;p) overwhelmed by the information available, and I’m not sure which valuation basis we’d use to calculate our freehold value (original or special valuation basis) let alone how I can manually calculate it!?!\n\nOur neighbour (who bought his freehold at a much lower price) was shocked at the price and advised that we should have served a notice instead of the polite request. He advised that we could let the 3 month offer from our landlord expire and then serve a notice. \n\nWe have a very limited budget and we are now wondering whether it is prudent to employ a chartered surveyor to independently value the freehold and take this figure to the landlord to negotiate? But the landlord could still refuse an independent valuation therefore negating our extra expense? \n\nThe issue we have with being leasehold is the extortionate insurance the landlord charges us - £1225 last year for fire cover only. With the cost of living impact in general it’s a struggle to pay this effectively pointless insurance on top of our existing house and contents insurance. I queried the figure and they said it was based on our house being valued at 1.5 million (rebuild). I challenged this as home insurance companies typically advise that the rebuild value is less than the house market value, but they wouldn’t budge, despite being told we have existing insurance, and told us that if we don’t like it our option is to buy the freehold.\n\nAny thoughts on the best way to proceed would be greatly appreciated. And whether the 8k is a reasonable or extortionate charge? Thanks in advance :)\n\n', ""I own a flat in a Victorian conversion (4 flats in total) and we are due to renew the policy. Our quote seems incredibly high (just under £2000 per year) for a joint insurance for all flats. One of the flats is being rented out and the remaining 3 are occupied by owners.\n\nAll of us have a leasehold as well as share of freehold (strangely, the proportions divided differently for both) and we can never agree on how to split the cost - should it be done according to the freehold proportion, leasehold proportion, size of property, or just evenly between all.\n\nWith the high quote I have done a little bit of reading and it seems that we could just have individual covers for each property - **is this true?**\n\nFor me this would mean a much lower quote and my mortgage provider has nothing against it. I can't see anything in my lease that would require us to have a joint policy.\n\n**Does anyone know is individual insurance policies can be done in this case and how does it work in terms of communal areas (in our case an entry hall). Also what happens if eg. the roof leaks, but not all flats are affected by it. Can I have an individual cover for my flat but specify that I also want to insure the communal hallway and the roof (even though my flat does not have a roof immediately over)?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advise would be much appreciated!"", ""Hello!\n\nWe bought our flat in February 2022, a maisonette in a 2 storey house that's been converted to 2 flats. There was a lot of confusion around the freehold at the time - it was advertised as freehold. When it came to the process of buying, it turned out that both flats are technically leasehold, but whoever owns the top flat (us) owns the freehold to the whole building. We fought for a long time to get this clarified, but our solicitors barely seemed to understand what was happening. There was a small amount of ground rent due from the other flat, and an agreement that they would pay half the buildings insurance. \n\nWe are getting quotes for this year (early, as we are expecting a baby at renewal time and I don't want to forget) and they have been in the region of £650. Is that normal/reasonable? Friends of ours own in similar sized properties, but as a complete house, and their premium is closer to £200. All the quote paperwork that we have filled out seems to expect us to be a company or landlord not resident in the building. We're just a couple who it turned out owned the whole freehold when we bought the property! \n\nIs there a specific kind of insurance we should be getting? Any particular brokers you would recommend for something like this? We have been getting wishy washy non answers from everyone about this since we bought the flat, solicitors, estate agents, insurance brokers...everything is difficult. We can't easily use comparison sites because of the situation, so it's really hard to know if this is a fair price or not. It feels like we're missing a piece of info!\n\nEdit: We're in England""]"
5,4,23,4_Shared Ownership House Purchase and Financial Considerations,['Shared Ownership House Purchase and Financial Considerations'],"['I\'m in process of buying my first house and I\'m trying to consider what costs to budget for and when they will need to be paid.\n\nI have already considered the ""buying costs"" as such I think. So the mortgage deposit, the mortgage arrangement fee, survey and valuation, solicitor fees, building and contents insurance which I\'ll need to arrange and pay for before we exchange contracts, 1 month of rent overlap to ease the pressure of furnishing a house and getting it ready to live in. There won\'t be removal costs as such because I live in a furnished rental and there\'s nothing I can\'t take by car to the new house. I have budgeted for furniture, sofas, mattresses, appliances, bedding, curtains, cushions, wall art, mirrors, accessories etc.\n\nAfter all this is paid for I should still have a sound emergency fund leftover so I\'d like to think I have covered the big one off costs and left myself some wiggle room too.\n\nWhat I\'m wondering is about the regular costs and when they will start coming along. I don\'t have a move in date yet so it\'s not totally predictable. \n\nMortgage- I have agreed the DD date will be on the 1st of the month and I know the first month will be higher by an amount depending how early in the month the completion date is. So the first payment will be a standard payment plus the interest for a portion of the previous month. Standard payment is going to be £1350 but I understand this could be up to £2400 for the first payment.\n\nCouncil Tax- how will this work? I\'ll probably move in August or September and the council tax year ends in March. Will they just calculate the number of days remaining, divided that by 365 then multiply by the annual rate and divide that equally across the remaining months of the year? \n\nWater- call the water company and give them a reading. The house already has a water meter. What will happen regarding the bill? Will they estimate and then reduce or increase accordingly and when should I expect to make a payment to them after move in?\n\nGas and electricity- I understand there is already a smart meter present so assuming I stick with the same provider (which I probably will initially to save hassle) what will happen? It\'s a smart meter so do they need meter readings? Will they estimate a bill and then adjust accordingly or will the bill be in real time because it\'s a smart meter? When will they need to be paid?\n\nBroadband- I\'ll probably get this from Vodafone so once it is set up what will happen? Monthly payments arranged to start the following month? \n\nHome and contents insurance will already have been paid upfront before moving in.\n\nIs there anything I\'m missing?\n\nI\'d appreciate timescales for when all these things will have to be paid and will the bills be higher initially etc? \n\nLet\'s assume I move in on 20th August (total guess) ', 'Hi, I\'m American and my husband is Hungarian and we have a 3 year old daughter. We\'re currently living in the Bay Area of CA. We moved here in early 2018 after spending several years in the Copenhagen metro area, since I got a job offer with relocation and I wanted to try out the crazy biotech scene here. I have a PhD and work in biotech (very specific niche role for which there are more jobs in the Bay Area than anywhere else) and my husband also has a PhD and is currently a senior engineer at a global company with a UK office in Gloucestershire. He might be able to arrange remote work with them and a lot of their UK staff are remote (he is currently over 95% work from home now).\n\nWhile there are things we like here, it\'s crazy expensive and competitive and I felt like I missed Denmark since the moment we got here. I\'ve mostly readjusted to the US but things that used to be normal to me drive me nuts now. Salaries are really high but it still feels like the cost of living eats it up. Quality of life is particularly poor where we\'re located in this region due to high crime and homelessness, and housing is too expensive to do anything but indefinitely rent and we\'re in our 40s and tired of this.\n\nSo I was recently contacted on LinkedIn by a UK headhunter for a highly appropriate role (right level and exactly what I do) and found out in a call today that the job is between Liverpool and Manchester (looked up exact location and it seems to be in a research park south of Warrington, technically in Daresbury) and he thinks I\'d be in the £55-60k salary range. If my husband could arrange something with his company, he would most likely also be in that range. Of course still a lot to get through with interviewing, and maybe they\'ll just prefer a UK candidate in the end etc, but I\'m trying to figure out what things look like cost of living wise there with £110-120k combined salaries? What would after tax monthly income look like, after pension and tax and all that? How much does childcare typically cost in this region and is it hard to find spots in daycares? How are public schools? \n\nWe would want to buy a house if we went there, maybe after initially renting to get our bearings. I\'m seeing 3 br free-standing homes listed for minimum £250-400k in the area (what does it mean when a listing says e.g. ""offers in excess of £235k"" - and do homes go well over list price usually or close to it? Bay Area is absurd and stuff goes for $300+k over list in bidding wars so I have no idea anymore). I could put a large deposit of maybe up to £120k and real estate website says on that for a £300k price it\'d only be £634/mo on a 35 year mortgage (friend there told us if you get a 35 year loan you can pay it back early, which we would definitely do at that price) which seems really low. What other costs are there, are there property taxes, home insurance etc and what would those add? \n\nThanks for any ballpark ideas and numbers, or any other comments about this region...would save me a lot of time vs extensive research when I don\'t even have an employment offer yet. I was happy the position was not in the southeast although I know the northwest is more rough but ""up and coming"", or at least that\'s been my impression.', ""(Just to say I might post this on a couple of similar subreddits, so you may see it again on there. For more context: I'm not down-south, more west-midlands)\n\nHi all,\n\nFirstly, please excuse any faux pas!\n\nAs per the title, dependant on personal circumstances, of course, but for me; is £500 per month to go towards savings acceptable as a FTB?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Here's a TL;DR, and then the more in-depth version is further below if you'd like to read it:\n\n* Is the 50-30-20 rule pretty safe to go by? I have about £500 left-over after all needs and wants paid off for the month (which is just below the '20' in the 50-30-20 rule, 18% to be specific). Looking for houses at around 260k max (including 26k deposit).\n* Want to buy the best house I can afford so I don't have to move out so soon.\n* I do have a mortgage in principle already. Obviously, this doesn't guarantee anything, but my calculations are based on the max the bank will lend me based on my current salary.\n* £9k (about 4 months' worth of monthly outgoings) in emergency fund, will this be enough?\n* Have I considered all monthly, 'one-off', and potential emergency costs (lists below)?\n* Likelihood of being accepted for an emergency loan with £500 going into savings per month? Let's say 2 big emergencies occur and I use all of my emergency savings and then have to take out a loan. Have strong credit score.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Full version (non-TL;DR - warning, there's a fair bit here as I like to be as prepared as possible!):\n\nIt's a bit of a two-part question;\n\n* Have I considered everything/most things in my list of monthly expenditure, 'one-off' expenditure, and potential emergency out-goings list?\n* How much should I realistically be left over with after all bills have been paid, to account for emergency loans and savings in particular? As I'd want to be sure that I would be able to take out emergency loans if needed for say 10k for a new car (I wouldn't need to spend that much on a new car, though, maybe only about 5k or so, just something to get me from A-to-B) or whatever if my old one goes bust.\n\nI'll say that I'd much rather move into a house that I really like and will stay in longer before moving, rather than a house I know I'll move on from in 3 or so years. I'm thinking more like 10+ years, so therefore I'm willing to spend more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Current situation:\n\n* Not in a rush to move out.\n* Work from home, so I don't really use the car a whole lot, which means low mileage, petrol costs, repairs, etc.\n* Live with parents (so I can save)\n* Single and no kids, and planning to stay single for the foreseeable\n* Tend not to spend money frivolously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Current saved up finances:\n\n£40,000\n\nAfter paying all one-off payments (including deposit), I'll be left with around 9k emergency fund, which is around 4 months' worth of monthly payments. From research, the consensus is between 3-6 months wages in emergency fund, obviously the more the better/safer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What I know I'll need to spend per month\n\n(Note: High/Medium/Low means the severity of whether I can reduce the out-goings if needed, High means I can't reduce it/very little, Medium I can compromise a bit more and Low I can heavily reduce the out-goings if needed):\n\n* Mortgage: £1100\n* Council tax: £131.25 (with 25% single occupancy discount) (£175 is the average)\n* (Medium) Entertainment/Food Subscriptions/Phone etc.: £61.82\n* (Medium) Food: Around £300 (this is both needs and wants, that's why it's higher than average, but I can definitely drop it by, say, £100 if absolutely necessary)\n* Utility Bills (Gas, Electric, Water, Internet):\n   * Gas & Electric: £250 (Seems a lot but I work from home so this might be accurate on the electric side of things, gas shouldn't be too bad as I don't like to leave the heating on for very long if I do turn the heating on the very rare occasion)\n   * Water: £35\n   * Internet: £35\n* Check critical illness and life insurance (need it to take out a mortgage): £35\n* (Low) Petrol: £75 (Overestimated)\n* Breakdown cover: £15\n* Car tax: £20\n* Car insurance: £50\n* (High) Dentist: £19.91\n* (High) Barbers: £7.50\n* Home insurance aka Building, electric, plumbing, home contents insurance: £43\n* Boiler: £20\n* (High) Toiletries (Including contact lenses): £10\n* (High) Security subscription for cameras and alarms: £32\n* (High) +Entertainment (£29 every 4 months, which every month:) £7.25\n* (High) Medical supplies: £1.58\n* (Low) Clothes\n* (Very Low, currently) Dating dates\n* (Low) Christmas, birthday, mother’s/father’s day gifts\n* Toilet roll: £6\n* Cleaning products: £12 + £4.50\n* Light bulbs: Negligible.\n\nTotal comes to around £2271 per month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What I know I'll need to pay as a one-off:\n\n* House Surveyor (Intermediate survey, not basic. High survey for really old building): £500\n* Solicitors: \\~£1500.\n* Removal and moving-in costs: Negligible.\n* Arrangement fee: £999\n* Valuation fee (Should be included in Arrangement fee)\n* Indemnity Insurance: (Not sure, yet, but it's a one-off payment unless your property significantly grows in value. Plus, the original homeowner may have already taken out indemnity insurance, so you can just take it over.)\n* Go see mortgage broker/advisor for: \\~£250\n* Home buyer's protection insurance: \\~£75\n\nFurniture and appliances, including:\n\n* Corner desk\n* Fridge\n* Sofa bed?\n* Microwave\n* Air fryer\n* Double bed\n* Washing machine\n* Dish washer.\n* Crockery and cutlery\n* Oven\n* Chest of drawers or wardrobe\n* Dining table and chair(s) (low prio)\n* Outside table and chairs (low prio)\n* Curtains and curtain rails (potentially)\n* Lamp shades\n\n= \\~£1000\n\n* Security cameras inside and outside the house.\n* Security alarms.\n* Stamp duty (ONLY applicable to properties over 250k and only NON-FTB homes, which means I don’t have to worry about it for my first home as you only pay it if it exceeds 450k on your first house):\n* Changing locks\n\nSo far it's around £4,325 in total. But that’s without indemnity insurance, removal and moving-in costs (low as I'll be buying new furniture for the most part), (potentially) valuation fee, security equipment. For arguments sake **let's say it's £5,000 in total**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Things I should save up for in the case of an emergency (please let me know of other things that you/people-you-know have had to shell out for in general emergency cases):\n\n* Increase in mortgage interest rates if they do go up (although I'm currently looking at a 5-year fixed rate mortgage, that's what I currently have for my MIP, so by then my salary will be higher when the term comes to an end)\n* House repairs\n* Car repairs and MOT.\n* A new car if the other one goes bust.\n* I guess I'll probably have to take out loans if I need to pay for house repairs, new appliances, etc.\n* House decorating/renovation/additions (to increase value when I come to sell it – this obviously isn't an emergency but a future cost to maybe think about to improve the chance of selling the house in \\~10 years)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Summary and afterthoughts\n\nI'm trying to ascertain how much I should realistically be spending per month on a mortgage and monthly bills.\n\nFor the max I can borrow, I would be left with around £500 to save per month. I currently don't have any debt (student loan but I've already deducted it), so I can put most if it into my emergency saving fund.\n\nWould you say that will be enough for savings? I've pretty much included my 'wants' in my monthly budget, and if we say follow the 50-30-20 rule, for my max mortgage I'll be at 82.61% (52.61% for musts, 30% for wants – although I have less of a percentage for wants and more for needs, so it's more like 62-20, and then about 18% for savings.\n\nWould people say as long as I keep as close to the 50-30-20 (or 80-20) rule, then I should be fine?\n\nJust to add on: If I don't max out my mortgage, I can go down by about 10-20k, which means I'll have a couple of thousand more in my emergency fund as I won't be spending as much on the deposit, but the change in mortgage itself will only save me about £100 per month if I get a house that is 20k cheaper than the max price-range I'm going for (260k).\n\nThe reality is, for the area I'm looking for, the house quality drastically falls off in terms of location, size, and things I'm really looking for in a house. The 260kers are typically perfect for me. Anything less and I'm heavily compromising. Admittedly the market is bad right now anyway, so hopefully the warmer weather might bring about more on the market.\n\nAnother thing is I can simply just wait. I can get a bigger deposit and maybe reduce the mortgage payments (slightly?) in say 12 months (I'm saving around £1,600 per month currently). I guess the only thing is we don't know if interest rates will go up, down, stay the same, etc. I wouldn't expect it to rocket, though. It seems like it's gradually beginning to go down.\n\nBut yes, any thoughts on anything above would be great. Please let me know if you'd like any further details/I've forgotten anything.\n\nThanks for reading.""]"
